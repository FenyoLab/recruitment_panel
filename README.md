This repository contains:

(1) ImageJ macro (Clip_and_Align_Nuclei.ijm) for measurement of intensity of micro-irradiated regions and background regions.  Please refer to the User Guide.

* Note: All ImageJ macros have been thouroughly tested on Mac OS.  Running the macro on a Windows/PC seems to have some instability (in step 3, measure_stripe: see User Guide for details) related to variability in the behaviour of ImageJ/Fiji versions.  If you encounter any problems, please open an Issue for help with troubleshooting.

(2) python scripts for visualization of results (make_heatmap2.py) and statistical tests (stats_for_proteins2.py).
